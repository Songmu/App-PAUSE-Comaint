NAME
    comaint - Make someone comaint of your module on PAUSE

SYNOPSIS
      comaint DBI FLORA

DESCRIPTION
    "comaint" is a command-line script to automate the process of logging in
    to PAUSE and making other PAUSE author as a co-maintainer of your
    module.

    The script will automatically fetch the list of packages included in the
    distribution that your given module belongs to. For example, if you run:

      comaint Plack MIYAGAWA

    it will gather all packages included in the Plack distribution, and try
    to make MIYAGAWA as a comaint.

    The script is written in a defensive manner so that if you specify a
    module that you don't have a primary maintainership, it will complain
    about that.

    There's also a prompt before actually making someone a co-maint.

PREREQUISITES
    *   You have to have a CPAN mirror cache in "~/.cpanm" to find the
        related packages. You can run `cpanm --mirror-only strict` once to
        get that cache.

    *   Your PAUSE credentials have to be saved in "~/.pause" file, the same
        as the one used by CPAN uploader.
